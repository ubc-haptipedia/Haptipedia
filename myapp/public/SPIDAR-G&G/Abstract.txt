In this paper, we propose a new haptic interface for tasks requiring two-handed manipulation. The system, named "SPIDAR-G&G", consists of a pair of string-based 6DOF haptic device called "SPIDAR-G". By grasping a special grip provided by each device, user can interact with virtual objects using both hands and accomplish lifelike biman-ual tasks in an intuitive manner. furthermore, the interface imparts user with the ability to feel different kind of force feedback. The system was evaluated by measuring "completion time" of a 3D pointing task, and shown to enhance interactivity for bimanual works.
