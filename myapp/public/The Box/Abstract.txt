Haptic interface serves as an ideal context and platform for teaching both system dynamics and embedded control. At The University of Michigan, a traditional undergraduate mechanical engineering course in systems dynamics and a new undergraduate electrical engineering course in embedded control systems have been equipped with instructional modules based on two new single-axis haptic interface devices. The iTouch motor is a low-budget, single axis, voice-coil based haptic device intended for teaching system dynamics fundamentals. Students gain hands-on experience by assembling these motors from scratch, performing experiments, and comparing actual to theoretically predicted dynamic response. A second device called "The Box" features higher torque output and robustness for the embedded control systems course. Both device designs are presented and contrasted and results following from their introduction into the curriculum are discussed. The uses of these devices to rapidly prototype various research projects and integrate undergraduate students into a research program are also briefly discussed.
