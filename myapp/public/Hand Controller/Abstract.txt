Performance of force-reflecting hand controllers, also called manual interfaces or manipulanda, is at present limited more by mechanical design than by computing hardware. Some of the important mechanical features of a high performance manual interface are: low inertia, low friction, high stiffness, backdriveability, high output force capability, multiple degrees-of-freedom, and sizeable range of motion. A four degree-of-freedom manipulandum, which utilizes a three degree-of-freedom parallel-link mechanism, was designed to incorporate the above features. The kinematic design of the manipulator motivated the definition of a forceltorque workspace as the volume of operation within which certain m ' m u m desired endpoint forces and torques can be achieved, given actuators of limited output. The design requires low actuator torques, is small in size, and does not approach joint limits in the workspace.
