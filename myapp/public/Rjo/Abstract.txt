The KONTUR-2 project is a joint venture between the German Aerospace Center (DLR), ROSKOSMOS, the Russian State Scientific Center for Robotics and Technical Cybernetics (RTC) and RSC Energia for the in-flight verification of force feedback and telepresence technologies. The main objectives of the KONTUR-2 project are the development of a space qualified 2 degrees of freedom (DoF) force feedback joystick (developed by DLR), the implementation of telepresence technologies and the investigation of the overall performance when telemanip-ulating robotic systems on Earth from space with force feedback. The feasibility study of using teleoperation for future planetary explorations with robots on distant planets teleoperated by a human orbiting the planet in a spacecraft (e.g. building habitats on Mars by teleoperated robots) is a desired outcome of the mission. The force feedback joystick was installed in the Rus-sian module of ISS in August 2015 and shall operate until December 2016. In August 2015 the first experiments were conducted successfully, two cosmonauts telemanip-ulated robots on ground at DLR and RTC from the ISS. This paper provides a general overview of the main components of the space qualified 2 DoF joystick where the requirements for a space qualified joystick, the joy-stick design such as the ergonomics design, the mechanical structure, the electronics and software architecture, the thermal concept and the bilateral control system are described .
