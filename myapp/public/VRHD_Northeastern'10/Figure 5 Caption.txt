Figure 5. The framework displaying the interactions of the system within itself and with the users. There are two computers in the system: the host computer provides practitioner interface through LabVIEW, and also runs the 3D game engine. The real-time target runs all the critical tasks such as data acquisition and controls. Communication within the host computer between LabVIEW and Panda3D is done via UDP whereas the communication between the host and real-time computers is carried out by LabVIEW Shared Variable Engine.
