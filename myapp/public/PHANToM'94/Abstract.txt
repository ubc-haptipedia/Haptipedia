This paper describes the PHANTOM haptic interface-a device which measures a user's finger tip position and exerts a precisely controlled force vector on the finger tip. The device has enabled users to interact with and feel a wide variety of virtual objects and will be used for control of remote manipulators. This paper discusses the design rationale, novel kinematics and mechanics of the PHANTOM. A brief description of the programming of basic shape elements and contact interactions is also given.
