Figure 5. Plots comparing force tracking in a non-linear Coulomb friction environment. Dotted line represents the desired interaction force, note how its sign flips periodically, this is related to the operator's velocity reversals. With interaction control (dark line) the operator's force profile closely matches the commanded value. Linear axis (bottom plot), horizontal lines indicate the friction envelope.
