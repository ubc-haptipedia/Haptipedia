Herein we describe a hands-on demonstration presented at the 2006 Symposium on Haptic Interfaces. Our device is a dissipative six degree-of-freedom haptic robot with a workspace of 2 cubic meters. By using dissipative actuators we are able to increase user safety. Our demonstration allows subjects to evaluate many of the haptic features that are required for a rich haptic environment.
