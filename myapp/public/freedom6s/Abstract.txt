A six-axis force feedback hand controller is described, suitable for interaction with virtual worlds or as part of a teleoperator system. It is composed of a 3 DOF position er base, a 3 DOF balanced translation stage, and a 3 DOF rotational distal stage which carries the handle. High spatial resolution, low friction and accurate force reproduction are available over an elliptical volume of 22 x 24 x 22 cm, appropriate for wrist size motion. The development and characteristics of the device are discussed, along with an example application to space telerobotics with appreciable time delay.
