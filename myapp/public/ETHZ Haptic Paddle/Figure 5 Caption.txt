Fig. 5. K-B plots showing the increase of the stable rendering region of a virtual spring damper system (K-B values selected from underneath the curve result in stable rendering) through position measurement and velocity estimation with increased sampling frequency (500 versus 100 Hz, both with a PCI DAQ card) from an electrooptical position encoder on the motor shaft compared to the hall sensor located on the paddle shaft. Note the different scales of the -axes.
