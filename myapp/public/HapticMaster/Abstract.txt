Abstract The article addresses the technical principles of a new high-performance haptic device, called HapticMaster, and gives an overview of its haptic performance. The HapticMaster utilizes the admittance control paradigm, which facilitates high stiffness, large forces, and a high force sensitivity. On top of that the HapticMaster has a large workspace, and a huge haptic resolution. Typical applications for the HapticMaster are therefore found in virtual reality, haptics research, and rehabilitation.
