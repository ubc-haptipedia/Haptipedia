Fig. 3. -width of the ETHZ haptic paddle over a frequency range up to 5 Hz, representative for interaction with human motion. Shown are the output impedance of the uncontrolled device (bold line, center), maximum renderable output impedance (top), and minimal output impedance (bottom) for both impedance control with force feedback and admittance control. The oscillations in the impedance of the uncontrolled device and the impedance control with force feedback result from a nonhomogeneous excitation of the device output over the frequency range up to 5 Hz.
