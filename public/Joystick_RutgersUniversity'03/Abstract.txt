Force-feedback mechanisms have been designed to simplify and enhance the human-vehicle interface. The increase in secondary controls within vehicle cockpits has created a desire for a simpler, more efficient human-vehicle interface. By consolidating various controls into a single, haptic feedback control device, information can be transmitted to the operator, without requiring the driver's visual attention. In this paper Electro-Rheological Fluids (ERF) based actuated mechanisms are presented that provide haptic feedback. ERFs are liquids that respond mechanically to electric fields by changing their properties , such as viscosity and shear stress electroactively. Using the electrically controlled rheological properties of ERFs, we developed haptic devices that can resist human operator forces in a controlled and tunable fashion. The design of two types of ERF-based actuators and joystick is presented in detail. Their analytical model is derived, parametric analysis is performed, and experimental systems and data are presented.
