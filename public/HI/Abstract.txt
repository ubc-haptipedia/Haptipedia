This paper describes design considerations for adding non-dominant hand interaction to a one-handed haptic interface. One implementation is described and contrasted to existing systems. We revisit the concept of indexing to move the virtual world relative to the real one and present several means of indexing that can be applied to a two-handed system. Two new hybrid modes of indexing are described and tested by novice users. Preliminary results suggest that users prefer one of the two hybrid modes over traditional modes.
