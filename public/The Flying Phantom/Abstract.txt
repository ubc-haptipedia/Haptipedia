It is well understood that for haptic interaction: free motion performance and closed-loop constrained motion performance have conflicting requirements. The difficulties for both conditions are compounded when increased workspace is required as most solutions result in a reduction of achievable impedance and bandwidth. A method of chaining devices together to increase workspace without adverse effect on performance is described and analysed. The method is then applied to a prototype, colloquially known as 'The Flying Phantom', and shown to provide high-bandwidth, low impedance interaction over the full range of horizontal movement across the front of a human user.
