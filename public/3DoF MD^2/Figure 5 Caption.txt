Figure 5: (a) Perfect torque source: Low-frequency, high-frequency, and combined DM2 actuator torque magnitude vs phase polar plot (b) Perfect torque source: Low-frequency, high-frequency, and combined DM2 actuator torque magnitude vs frequency. G(s)LF: low-frequency actuator closed loop transfer function, G(s)HF: High-frequency actuator transfer function, G(s)DM2actuation: Combined DM 2 actuator transfer function, ?LF: open-loop natural frequency of low-frequency actuator, ?LF?closed?loop: closed-loop bandwidth of low-frequency SEA controller
