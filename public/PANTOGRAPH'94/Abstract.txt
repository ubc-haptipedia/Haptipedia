A method to carry out the design of linkage for a haptic interface is described. Factors such as size, workspace, intrusion, inertia, response and structural properties are considered in this process. The dependencies of the various criteria are examined and a hierarchical method is applied. The result is a compact device which is easy to manufacture and which fulfills the requirements demanded by its application. Severa! quantitative measures designed to capture its principal properties are at the heart the process.
