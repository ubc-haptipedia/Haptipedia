This paper describes the biomechanical experimental validation of simulating side slope during walking on a treadmill style locomotion interface. The side slope effect is achieved by means of a lateral force applied to the waist of the walking subject. Results are provided and discussed for both simulated and real side slopes, showing a substantial biomechanical equivalence in the walking pattern for the real side slope and lateral torso force.
