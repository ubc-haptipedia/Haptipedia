Figure 15. Possible haptic interactions with the described device and VR system. Schematics A and B show the possible implementation of haptic feedback using a force field or gradient that the patient would feel as force feedback. Schematics C and 0 are the most viable haptic models for the current VR software, due to practitioner input the left was chosen. Schematic E is more abstract as the VR may not directly map to the haptic feedback the patient feels.
