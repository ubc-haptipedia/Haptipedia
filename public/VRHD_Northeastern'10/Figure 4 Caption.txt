Figure 4. The cross-section view of the ERF-actuators. The arrows show the direction of flow in the linear actuator (left). Dark arrows indicate higher pressure, and the light arrows indicate lower pressure. The pressure drop that is controlled by the electric field across the valve causes a net force on the piston. The rotary actuator (right) works with the same basic principle, except the piston is replaced by a rotary vane.
